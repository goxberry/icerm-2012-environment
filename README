Files specifying computational environment for demonstration at ICERM 2012:
Reproducibility for Computational and Experimental Mathematics.

Requirements:
- VirtualBox 4.2.x: http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
- Vagrant 1.0.5: http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.0.5
- Git Bash Shell (Windows only)

Upon first start, run "./bootstrap.sh" within repo.

To log in:
User name: vagrant
Password: vagrant

To start a graphical interface (if one does not come up; on first boot, there
will be a text prompt after login), type "startx" at the prompt.

To see example, look at "/home/vagrant/icerm-example/Robertson.ipynb" and
"/home/vagrant/icerm-example/Robertson.py"; the repository
"https://github.com/goxberry/icerm-2012-example" should be automatically cloned
to "/home/vagrant/icerm-example". The Python source can be examined in any
text editor or IDE; the IPython notebook can be examined by calling
"ipython notebook --script" within the working directory
"/home/vagrant/icerm-example".

Relevant commands (on local machine, not in VM):
"vagrant up" (brings up machine if not already booted up)
"vagrant halt" (shuts down machine if not shut down)
"vagrant provision" (updates configuration if configuration files change)
"vagrant suspend" (suspends VM)
"vagrant resume" (resumes VM)
"vagrant destroy" (destroys all VM files, but not configuration files)

NOTE: If VM destroyed using "vagrant destroy", can rebuild VM using
"vagrant up".
